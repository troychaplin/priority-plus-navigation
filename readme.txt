Adds Priority+ pattern to core Navigation block. Moves overflow items into responsive "More" dropdown as the users viewport narrows.

== Description ==

Priority Nav extends the core WordPress Navigation block as a variation, implementing the Priority+ design pattern. It displays the most important navigation items in the main menu bar and automatically moves overflow items into a "More" dropdown menu (default label: "Browse") when horizontal space is limited.

Key Features:

* **Automatic Overflow Detection**: Continuously monitors available space and adjusts navigation visibility
* **Responsive by Design**: Adapts to any screen size or container width
* **Customizable Labels**: Change the "More" button text and icon
* **Seamless Integration**: Works beautifully with WordPress themes
* **Performance Optimized**: Uses ResizeObserver for efficient layout calculations
* **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly

Perfect for sites with many navigation items that need to work across all device sizes without compromising usability.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/priority-nav` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add a Navigation block and select the "Priority Plus Navigation" variation, or search for "Priority Plus Navigation" in the block inserter
4. Configure your navigation using the familiar WordPress navigation tools

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Priority+ pattern work? =

The Priority+ pattern prioritizes the most important navigation items by keeping them visible in the main navigation bar. When there isn't enough horizontal space for all items, less important items are automatically moved into a "More" dropdown menu. As the viewport width changes, items dynamically move in and out of the dropdown.

= Can I customize the "More" button text? =

Yes! In the block inspector panel, you can customize both the "More" button label (default: "Browse") and choose from different icons: none (default), chevron down, plus, or menu symbols.

= Does it work with nested navigation items? =

Yes! Items with submenus in the dropdown are converted to accessible accordions that respect the Core Navigation "Open submenus on click" setting.

= How does it work with WordPress's responsive overlay menu? =

Priority Plus Navigation intelligently integrates with WordPress core navigation overlay menu settings:

* **Never**: Priority+ is always active across all screen sizes
* **Mobile**: Priority+ works on desktop and automatically disables when the hamburger menu activates
* **Always**: Not compatible - Priority+ is automatically disabled and the "Always" option appears greyed out in the editor

= Is it accessible? =

Yes, the block is built with accessibility in mind, supporting keyboard navigation and providing proper ARIA labels for screen readers.
