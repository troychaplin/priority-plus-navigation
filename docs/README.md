# Priority Plus Navigation - Documentation

## What is Priority+?

Priority Plus Navigation is a responsive design pattern that solves a common problem: fitting many navigation items into limited horizontal space without immediately hiding everything behind a hamburger menu.

### The Problem

Traditional navigation approaches face challenges:

- **Fixed navigation**: Items wrap or overflow on smaller screens
- **Hamburger-only**: Hides all items, reducing discoverability
- **Mega menus**: Complex and difficult to maintain

### The Priority+ Solution

Priority+ provides a progressive approach:

1. **Wide screens**: All navigation items visible
2. **Medium screens**: Less important items move to "More" dropdown
3. **Narrow screens**: Only most important items visible, rest in dropdown
4. **Dynamic**: Automatically adjusts as viewport changes

### Benefits

- **Better discoverability** - Important items always visible
- **Graceful degradation** - Progressive disclosure as space decreases
- **No hamburger needed** - Maintains horizontal navigation on desktop
- **Mobile friendly** - Works with WordPress hamburger menu on mobile
